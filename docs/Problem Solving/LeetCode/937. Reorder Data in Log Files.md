# 937. Reorder Data in Log Files

## Description

You are given an array of `logs`. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
Reorder these logs so that:

The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
Return the final order of the logs.

## Solution

### Approach

1. Identifier(alphabet + number) + nums only or chars only
2. To check whether it is a number, use string.isdigit
3. Seperate with letters[], digits[]
4. Sort letters only

### Implementation

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        letters, digits = [], []
        for log in logs:
            # the first value(except for identifier) is important.
            if log.split()[1].isdigit():
                digits.append(log)
            else:
                letters.append(log)
        letters.sort(key=lambda x: (x.split()[1:], x.split()[0]))
        return letters + digits
```

### Complexity Analysis

- $n$: length of `logs`
- Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$
