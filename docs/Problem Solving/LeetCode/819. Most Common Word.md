## Description

Given a string `paragraph` and a string array of the banned words `banned`, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.

The words in `paragraph` are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

## Solution

### Approach

1. Delete other characters except for alnum+underscore with `re.sub`.
2. List Comprehension makes code simple.

### Implementation

```python
import collections
import re
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
        words = [word for word in re.sub(r'[^\w]', ' ', paragraph)
            .lower().split()
                 if word not in banned]

        counts = collections.Counter(words)

        # print(counts.most_common(1)) -> [('ball',2)]
        return counts.most_common(1)[0][0]
```

### Complexity Analysis

- $n$: length of `paragraph`, $m$: length of `banned`
- Time Complexity: $O(nm)$
- Space Complexity: $O(n)$
