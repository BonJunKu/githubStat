# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Solution 1

### Approach

1. When the price of stock becomes more expensive than yesterday, maximum profit increases.
2. But if it becomes cheaper than yesterday, you need to consider 2 cases:
   1. Today's price is more expensive than minimum price.
   2. Today's price is cheaper than minimum price.
3. If it is **Case 2**, the basis of calculating maximum profit changes. So you need to update minimum price.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = 10001
        max_profit = 0

        for price in prices:
            if min_price > price:
                min_price = price

            if (price - min_price) > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price

        return max_profit
```

### Complexity Analysis

- $n$: length of `prices`
- Time Complexity: $O(n)$
- Space Complexity: $O(1)$

## Solution 2

### Approach

1. Approach with Brute Force.

### Implementation

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_price = 0

        for i, price in enumerate(prices):
            for j in range(i, len(prices)):
                max_price = max(prices[j] - price, max_price)

        return max_price
```

## Solution 3

### Approach

1. Almost same with `Solution 1`
2. Initialize minimum value with `sys.maximize`.

### Implementation

```python
import sys
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        min_price = sys.maxsize

        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            profit = max(profit, price - min_price)

        return profit
```
