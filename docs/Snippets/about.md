# Snippets

This is a page for code snippets.

One of the biggest things I've learned from working on multiple projects is the importance of keeping code snippets independent of the project.
When I get stuck while implementing a feature, I end up doing a lot of Googling. And if I want to reimplement the feature I've hardly implemented in the future, I often have to start Googling again.

As a result, I write down code snippets to make repetitive tasks easier.
